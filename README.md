#  SwiftUI + SpriteKit + macOS Experiments

Unsurprisingly, I struggle endlessly with getting apps to work on macOS
when I try to combine SwiftUI and SpriteKit. This repo contains my latest
and greatest attempts, which, shockingly enough, work pretty well. The main
difficulty I've always had is in handling user input, but as of 2024.0429,
I'm able to track mouse movement, dragging, clicking, and scroll wheel,
**in a SwiftUI SpriteView**, which is enough for my purposes, at least for now.
